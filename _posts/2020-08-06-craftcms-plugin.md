I want to create a [custom export type in craftcms](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/extend/element-exporter-types.html#creating-custom-exporter-types)

This necessitates [creating a craftcms plugin](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/extend/plugin-guide.html) and handily there is [a site that will generate the scaffolding](https://pluginfactory.io/).
